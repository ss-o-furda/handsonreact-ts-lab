# React Tutorial using TypeScript

## Build a project management application step-by-step in React

- Uses TypeScript
- Uses only function components with Hooks
- Uses a pre-built Node.js REST API as a backend to do CRUD operations
- Uses React Router
- After getting it working, refactor your code to use Redux
- Test the application using React Testing Library
